# FlowField Generator with P5.js

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a FlowField generator using P5.js. A FlowField is a technique where a vector field is used to control the movement of particles on a canvas.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript programming.
- Familiarity with P5.js and setting up a canvas.

## Step 1: Initial Setup

The first thing we need to do is set up our development environment. Make sure you have a project folder with the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file where we will link P5.js and our JavaScript script.
- `sketch.js`: The JavaScript file where we will write our code to generate the FlowField.

In the `index.html` file, add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>FlowField with P5.js</title>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.4.0/p5.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="sketch.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
